## Slimmage - sane & simple responsive images

Your wait for a sane, easily managed path to responsive images has now ended.

**With Slimmage, *CSS* controls which image size is downloaded, not HTML**


* **Media queries, breakpoints, nested percentages, & `max-width` work as expected**.
* **Works on > 99% of browsers. 3KB minified *vanilla js*, 1.5KB compressed.**
* **Cookie-free; works on first page load. Works with CDNs**.
* **Fully accessible; degrades gracefully without javascript**
* **Massive bandwidth reduction. No duplicate requests. Can auto-enable WebP and adjust compression based on pixel density**
* **Works with any [RIAPI-compliant](http://riapi.org) backend. [ImageResizer](http://imageresizing.net) is preferred.**

Handles any viewport size and pixel density with ease. Yes, retina and retina-like displays are supported.

Tested on IE6-10, Firefox 3.6-23, Opera 11-12, Safari 5-6, Chrome 14-28, Opera Mobile, and over a dozen mobile Webkit browsers. Essentially everything [supported by BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/screenshots). In theory we should be supporting over 99.5% of browsers.

### [Demo page](http://imazen.github.io/slimmage/demo.html) using [PureCSS](http://purecss.io/), slimmage.js, & [ImageResizer](http://imageresizing.net).

**If [you're on Windows or IIS, read this guide for the easiest implementation path](http://imageresizing.net/blog/2013/effortless-responsive-images)**

## Sample markup

```html
<noscript data-slimmage>
  <img class="halfsize" src="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=150" />
</noscript>

<style type="text/css">
  img.halfsize {max-width:50%;}
</style>

<script src="/slimmage.js" ></script>
```    
    
## Sample markup with IE6/7/8 support

IE6, 7, & 8 are unable to access the contents of a noscript tag, and we are therefore required to duplicate the attributes.
If you didn't care about non-javascript enabled users, you could drop the inner `img` element, but we wouldn't advise it.

```html
<noscript data-slimmage data-img-class="halfsize" data-img-src="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=150">
  <img class="halfsize" src="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=150" />
</noscript>
```

## Sample markup with WebP and quality adjustment enabled, console logging disabled.

```html
<noscript data-slimmage>
  <img class="halfsize" src="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=150&format=jpg&quality=90" />
</noscript>

<style type="text/css">
  img.halfsize {max-width:50%;}
</style>

<script type="text/javascript">
    window.slimmage = {tryWebP:true, verbose:false};
</script>
<script src="/slimmage.js" ></script>
```

## Sample markup for LQIP (Low-quality image placeholders) mode

**Warning - this syntax will cause 2 network requests on many browsers**

```html
<img data-slimmage="true" src="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=100&format=jpg&quality=75" />
```

## Sample markup for future browsers (IE11, etc)

**Warning - this syntax will cause 2 network requests on browsers which support image prefetching but don't support [Resource Priorities](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourcePriorities/Overview.html).**

IE11 is [supposed to support the lazyload attribute](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/ResourcePriorities/Overview.html), and we expect other vendors will follow suit soon.

```html
<img lazyload data-slimmage="true" src="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=100&format=jpg&quality=75" />
```

## Sample markup for CSS background-image

**Warning: support for `background-image` is experimental, and has limited browser support.**

The implementation relies on `querySelectorAll`, which is available for IE8+. Styling with `background-size: 100% auto` is a good idea to keep the whole width of the image visible, but note that it works only on IE9+.

```html
<div data-slimmage-bg="http://z.zr.io/ri/1s.jpg?width=150">
    <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
</div>

<style type="text/css">
    [data-slimmage-bg] {
        background-size: 100% auto;
    }
</style>
```

### Notes

* Slimmage requires "width=[number]" be present in the URL. This value specifies the image size when javascript is disabled, but is modified by slimmage.js under normal circumstances.
* It can also adjust compression quality based on device pixel ratio, if "quality=[number]" is present.
* If WebP is enabled, it can automatically detect and request WebP images instead.
* The final `max-width` applied to the element determines which image file size is downloaded. Unlike earlier versions, a sizing image is not used, and 'width' and 'height' properties are ignored in the selection process.
* Images are loaded immediately after stylesheets download. Slimmage add 2ms of javascript execution time per image.

**It's a good idea to use a helper method or HTML filter to generate slimmage's required markup. Everything works cross-browser today, but browser vendors have a long and venerable tradition of breaking responsive image solutions.**

* For IIS or ASP.NET, there's [SlimResponse](https://github.com/imazen/slimresponse), an output filter that simplifes the markup down to `<img src="image.jpg?width=150&slimmage=true" />`

Feel free to fork and add links to your HTML filters/helpers here!


### Release notes


* 0.1 - Dynamically injected a twin image tag with a sizer gif (4k wide transparent gif) to let the browser calculate the desired size, then used that for the image URI.
* 0.2 - Implemented direct reading of the calculated 'max-width' value and conversion of non-px units via a dynamic sibling div (faster and added IE6,7,8 support).
* 0.2.1 - Fixed IE bug related to console.log: https://github.com/imazen/slimmage/issues/2
* 0.2.2 - Fixed another IE bug related to console.log: https://github.com/imazen/slimmage/issues/2
* 0.2.3 - Added `window.slimmage.readyCallback` callback - occurs after first adjustment of all images. Added `s.adjustImageParameters(data)` to allow size/quality/format customization. Fixed incorrect quality calculation bug. All code contributed by Per Osb√§ck and Ola Andersson! Release tested on BrowserStack.
